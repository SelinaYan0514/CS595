# CS595 Blockchains and their Applications (Fall 2025)  
## Course Overview  
Blockchain technology amalgamates technical tools, economic mechanisms, and system design patterns. It facilitates the construction of information systems with novel combinations of robustness, decentralization, privacy, cost, and flexibility. Beyond their initial use in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, blockchains have become a promising and powerful technology in business, financial services, law, and other areas.  

This course covers blockchain technology in a comprehensive, systematic, and interdisciplinary way. It surveys major approaches, variants, and applications of blockchains in these areas. Beyond a solid grasp of the principles, the course aims to build familiarity with practice through numerous case studies and hands-on projects.  

To facilitate its interdisciplinary perspective, this course will be open to two categories of students: students with Computer Science background (graduate or advanced undergraduate), and graduate students with a substantial Business or Law background and a working knowledge of computer programming.  

Projects will be done in heterogeneous teams combining these categories, and will center on devising and analyzing sample applications of blockchain technology, including both prototype implementations and analysis of its business/legal implications.

## Syllabus  

### Core Topics  
- Disentangling "blockchain"  
- Cryptographic prerequisites  
- Assets and their representations  
- Cryptocurrencies (UTXO and account models)  
- Stablecoins (backed and algorithmic)  
- Non-fungible tokens  

### On-chain Programming  
- Scripts, smart contracts, Solidity, pitfalls  

### State Consensus  
- State machine replication  
- Centralized: Byzantine Fault Tolerance  
- Decentralized: Proof of Work/Stake (security and economics)  
- Sharding, sidechains, rollups, bridges  

### Deployment  
- Protocol launch, asset creation, forks, open source, ecosystem  

### Decentralized Applications (Dapps/Web3)  
- Components: on-chain code, frontends, backends, wallets  
- Examples: trading, AMMs, collateralized lending, flash loans, staking, gaming  
- Security: risks of rigid protocols and composition  

### Governance & Applications  
- Protocol governance  
- Provenance tracking  
- Transparency  
- Asset tokenization  

### Business Models & Market Structure  
- Protocol revenue: token issuance, fees, airdrops, DAOs  
- Market structure: funding models, token liquidity, exchanges, OTCs, on/off-ramps, lockups  
- Recent fiascos (and avoidance strategies)  

### Privacy & Regulation  
- Chain analytics  
- Permissioned chains  
- Privacy and zero-knowledge proofs  
- Anti-money laundering, securities regulation, taxation, privacy laws  

Connections between these topics, and to real-world projects, will be explored through abundant examples and suggestions for further reading. Class time will also be allocated to student project presentations and feedback.
