# Assignment 3: Bitcoin Transaction and Generation

## Introduction
In this assignment, you will delve into the practical aspects of Bitcoin.  
Your task will involve understanding Bitcoin transactions, specifically focusing on **transaction scripts**.  
You will apply your **Python skills** to solve a real-world challenge: **accepting and spending Bitcoin funds**.

## Background
In Bitcoin, funds are locked in a transaction output (**TXO**) using a script (**scriptPubKey**) that requires a specific input to unlock (i.e., spend).

As seen in class, some of the common types of `scriptPubKey` are:

- **P2PK (Pay-to-Public-Key)**  
  Specifies a public key (i.e., a verification key of a digital signature scheme) and requires a matching signature on the transaction.

- **P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash)**  
  Specifies a hash digest and requires a public key that hashes to the digest, alongside a matching signature on the transaction.  
  A P2PKH script is of the form:


The corresponding addresses are called **"P2PK address"** and **"P2PKH address"** respectively, because the owner of a public key can tell people to send money to their public key simply by telling them what `scriptPubKey` (of either form) to use in a new TXO.

The `scriptPubKey` can also express other types of conditions for spending the funds.

## Overview
The course staff have designated some coins for you and locked them with a **P2PKH script** on the Bitcoin blockchain  
(or more precisely, a Bitcoin testnet called **Signet**, which behaves just like the real Bitcoin blockchain, but does not have monetary value).

Your goal is to **accept the funds from one of the transaction outputs** and **move them to another account**.  
To do so, you need to:

1. Create a new transaction whose **input** is an unspent TXO containing the lock script (`scriptPubKey`).  
2. Specify a new **TXO** with another address (or script) where you want to send the Bitcoins.  

The **secret key** to unlock your TXO was sent to you via email.  
Your challenge is to:
- Find the relevant TXO.  
- Understand how its locking script works.  
- Satisfy it using the secret text you were given.  
- Create a new transaction that spends that TXO and sends the funds to another address.
